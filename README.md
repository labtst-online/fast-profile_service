# Profile Service

The Profile Service is responsible for managing user profile data, including nickname, avatar icons, personal descriptions. It is part of the FastAPI app.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – Web framework
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **Redis** – Caching and temporary storage
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **AWS S3** – Storage for user-uploaded icons
- **GitHub Actions** – Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- **Pytest** – Test framework

## API Endpoints

- `GET /profile/me` – Retrieve current user's profile
- `PUT /profile/me` – Create or update current user's profile

> The endpoints above require a valid JWT token generated by the `auth_service`.

- `GET /profile/{profile_id}` - Get user profile by user ID

## Getting Started

> This service depends on the `auth_service`. It's recommended to run the full system using [`fast-deployment`](https://github.com/labtst-online/fast-deployment).
